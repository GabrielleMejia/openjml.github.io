      <h2>Verify Your Java Programs with JML</h2>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/JML/jmldbc.pdf">Java Modeling Language</a> is a mature program specification with over a decade of history. OpenJML is capable of checking of checking programs written in the Java Modeling Language and provides robust support for many of <a href="/features">JML's features</a>.  </p>

      <h2>Support for Static and Runtime Checking</h2>
      <p>Verification in OpenJML can be performed either by using our extended static checking facilities or by using our runtime assertion checking features. Runtime assertion checking is often easier to write specifications for whereas static checking gives stronger guarantees about program behavior.  </p>

      <h2>Integrates with most popular SMT Solvers</h2>
      <p>OpenJML is not a theorem prover or model checker itself. OpenJML translates JML specifications into SMT-LIB format and passes the proof problems implied by the Java+JML program to backend SMT solvers. OpenJML provides for major SMT solvers such as Z3 and Yices.</p>
