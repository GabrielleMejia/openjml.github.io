This folder contains the files for the on-line tutorial.
The files are in GitHub markup.
Unfortunately, GitHub does not support file includes,
which makes inserting code examples a nuisance.

We want to be able to test the code examples, so we need them 
and their output in standalone files.
We can either (1) write the examples directly in the file
and use a tool to extract them or (2) write them in separate
files and use a tool to assemble the .md files.

We are doing the latter. Any file that desires to have an %include
is written as a .mdt file. Then the ./insert_includes script
inserts the contents of included files into the .mdt file and
produces a corresponding .md file, if there is any change.

The .md files, although they are generated, need to be committed to
the repo so that github will display them as part  of thte github pages
for www.openjml.org.

So 
a) edit your files as .mdt files, 
b) use insert_includes to create or update the .md files,
c) and commit & push all changed files to git

Git runs insert_includes as part of a pre-commit hook.
If there are any updates to the .md file, the commit does not happen.
Once the changes have been reviewed, the .md file can be committed
 again.

[The commit hook is in ../.git/hooks/pre-commit]
