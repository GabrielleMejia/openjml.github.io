# Tutorial

These pages provide a quick introduction to JML (the Java Modeling Language) and 
OpenJML (a tool that implements checks of the specifications written in JML for Java programs)
in the form of an on-line tutorial.
Aside from the installation instructions, you can read the _General_ pages as needed and dive right in to the section on Method Specifications.

The tutorial does not cover all aspects of JML and OpenJML. See also the 
[JML Reference Manual](../documentation/JML_Reference_Manual.pdf)
and the [OpenJML Reference Manual](../documentation/OpenJMLUserGuide.pdf).
